		<p><h4>About the visualization</h4>
		This map shows the state-by-state differences in population growth rate between 2010 and 2013. The darker states have higher growth rates, and you can hover over the individual states to see the exact statistic.</p>

		<p>I made this visualization using D3.js, a JavaScript library that facilitates the pairing of data with DOM elements in an exceptionally simple and accessible manner. I also used TopoJSON, a library by Mike Bostock (also the creator of D3) that helps with the rendering of GeoJSON files.  Once you get a hang of the syntax and stringing patterns, they’re both quite easy to work with, so let’s dive into how one could go about binding data to a map. </p>
